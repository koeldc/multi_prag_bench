# Introduction to the Ambiguous Sentence Task

## Overview

**Your task is to write ambiguous sentences**. A sentence is ambiguous if there are multiple ways to understand it. 

You will be presented with a word and two of its meanings. For example, the word *bank* and its two word senses "*a financial institution*" and "*slope next to a river*". Your task is to write one sentence where the word is used in such a way that depending on how you choose to interpret it, either meaning could apply.

For example, you could write something like: "*On Saturday morning, I went to the bank.*" The word *bank* here could realistically be either of the two word senses, a financial institution or a slope next to a river, so this would be acceptable.

When writing sentences, please try to uphold the following principles:

* **Ideally, both word senses should be equally plausible.**
* **Please make sure that the word appears exactly once in the sentence.**
* **The goal is not to write puns, but to write sentences that allow for multiple interpretations.**
* **Submissions that clearly contain AI generated content will be rejected.**

## Good Examples

---

**Word**: *racket*  
**Meaning 1**: *a loud and disturbing noise*  
**Meaning 2**: *implement used in sports, e.g. tennis racket*  

**Good Example**: *I couldn't concentrate at all because of the loud racket from the tennis game.*  

**This is good**: It could refer to the tennis game itself being loud (meaning 1), or the speaker specifically complains about the sound of the tennis racket (meaning 2). The sentence is plausibly ambiguous.

**Word**: *season*  
**Meaning 1**: *a set of related television programs*  
**Meaning 2**: *the four times of year (spring, summer, fall, winter)*  

**Good Example**: *Anna thinks that this is the best season.*  

**This is good**: We don't know what "*this*" refers to. It could be either a time of year or a television series. Because of this, the sentence remains successfully ambiguous.

## Bad Examples

**Word**: *bat*  
**Meaning 1**: *an implement with a handle used for hitting the ball in games such as cricket or baseball.*   
**Meaning 2**: *a nocturnal mammal capable of sustained flight*  

**Bad Example**: *The bat flew out of the cave.*  

**This is bad**: It is not plausible that this refers to an implement like a baseball bat. The word "bat" is not used ambiguously.  

---

**Word**: *root*  
**Meaning 1**: *part of the plant which attaches it to the ground*  
**Meaning 2**: *the basic cause, source or origin of something*  

**Bad Example**: *The root of the problem was buried deep, just like the roots of the old oak tree in the yard.*  
 
**This is bad**: The word is used multiple times. *Root* should be used only once, and that occurrence should encompass both meanings.

## Task Procedure

You will first have to pass a simple 4-question qualification test to confirm that you are human and understand English. The qualification test will ask you to pick the best meaning for a word in a short text. If you fail the qualification test, you will not be able to start writing.

If you pass qualification, the writing page will automatically unlock for you.

If you cannot think of a sentence for the given word, you can press the button on the top of the page to get a new word. You can use the button as many times as you want. You have to write five sentences to clear the task.

## Good luck and have fun!
