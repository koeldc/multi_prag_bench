# Introduction to the Ambiguity Annotation Task

## Overview

You will see a short story of four sentences. One word in the last sentence is highlighted in color. The highlighted word typically can take on two (or more) different meanings, depending on the context. Your task is to annotate which of the two displayed meanings of the word is likely to be the correct one.

The general rules are as follows:

* **If one of the word senses is clearly likelier than the other, only pick that one**.
* **If both word senses seem plausible, pick both**. Even if one word sense is generally more frequent than the other, both should be picked if the meaning is plausible in the given context.
* **If neither sense is plausible, pick neither**. If the word has a third word sense that seems more plausible than either of the displayed meanings, pick neither and comment the sense in the free text field.

You can also mark sentences as *nonsensical*, meaning that the story makes no sense no matter which meaning of the word is used. Even if a story is nonsensical, try picking the meaning that makes it 'less nonsensical'. You can simply go with your intuition here. 

Also, feel free to add comments in the comment field.

If the ambiguous word appears multiple times in the text, annotate *only* the instance that is highlighted in color.

The stories are designed to be subjective; there will be many times where there is no objectively correct answer. Whatever the case, carefully think about how much sense a reading would make in the context of the story.

## Examples

"Mr Ellis walked to the town square with a big smile. He carried his easel with him. He was getting ready to paint. Whenever he sets up his easel in the town square, he always :blue-background[draws] a crowd."

[x] represent by making a drawing of, as with a pencil, chalk, etc. on a surface  
[x] to attract 

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: He may literally depict the people in the crowd in his drawing, or his drawings may simply attract onlookers. Both are plausible, so both should be picked.

"I went to the library. I read some of the books. There were some really interesting ones. After getting inspiration from other authors, I had an idea that was quite :blue-background[novel]."

[x] interestingly new or unusual  
[ ] a fictitious prose narrative of book length

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: Don't get confused by the context! The speaker may have read some novels, but in the last sentence, *novel* clearly refers to something new or unusual.

"Linda was having a stressful day at work. She kept receiving complaints from clients. It took a long time to process all of them. She had no time to take a :blue-background[break]."

[ ] to surpass (a record)  
[ ] separate as a result of a blow, shock or strain

**There is a better meaning**: *to rest*  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: Neither of the meanings fit, so do not check either meaning and write a better one.

# The Annotation Procedure

You will first have to pass the qualification test. It only consists of three questions, but you will fail if you make even one mistake. It is mostly to filter out bots and should be no problem if you carefully look at the sentences and determine which sense is more likely (or both/neither).

**If you fail at the qualification test**: You will not be able to start the annotation. ***IMPORTANT***: **Remember to copy the Screen-Out Completion Code that will be displayed to Prolific.** You will get a small amount of money as compensation for your time.

**If you succeed at the qualification test**: Once you pass the qualification test, you will automatically unlock access to the annotation page. It is structurally identical to the qualification. Each participant is assigned 72 samples. We expect each sample to take 40-60 seconds, so it will likely take around 50 minutes in total.

Your progress for both qualification and annotation is **saved automatically** anytime you press the *NEXT* button.
