    "0": "Welcome to the Story Ending Annotation Task.\n\nYour task is to create stories from building blocks so that the meaning of a word in the story changes.\n\nAs an example, take the word \"mouse\". It can refer to either an animal or an electronic device (like a computer mouse), depending on the context.\n\nThe below story currently just consists of the sentence: \"I am looking for the mouse\". It's not clear what the word means here. Your task now: **Construct a context where the meaning 'electronic device' is implied for 'mouse'.**\n\nYou construct a context by adding a 'first part' and a 'last part'. Let's start with the first part.\n\n**:red[Use the templates to pick a 'first part' that fits the desired meaning.]**",
    "1": ":red[The meaning you picked does not imply that mouse means 'computer mouse'. Please try again.] Choose an option that suits the desired meaning.",
    "2": ":green[Good!] Well, almost. This is definitely the better choice, but it's not perfect. First, we want to avoid reusing the focus word (in this case 'mouse') in the context. Second, searching for your mouse after already connecting it is a bit illogical.\n\nLuckily, you can edit sentences as you like. For example, you could replace 'connecting my mouse' with 'connecting my keyboard', or even delete the entire second sentence. In other cases, you may even choose to add more sentences.\n\n:red[Try it now by pressing the 'Edit selected sentence' button.]",
    "3": ":red[In its current state, the first part has the issue of the word 'mouse' being explicitly mentioned in the context. Please try editing the sentence.]",
    "4": ":green[You edited the first part successfully.] Now the only thing left to do is select a template for the last part. Note that you could also pick '(No ending necessary)'. If you feel like the text is already good as-is and the meaning is sufficiently implied, that is also a valid option.\n\n:red[Think about it and pick something for the last part.] There is no 'correct' answer here.",
    "5": ":red[This ending mentions 'squeaking', which is a bit strange for the context we want. You could try editing it, or you can pick one of the other endings.]",
    "6": ":green[OK!] Confirm your story in the field below.",
    "7": "This concludes the explanation. You will have to write ten of these texts in total. Keep in mind that you are allowed to be creative and deviate from the templates, as long as the wanted meaning is implied. Good luck and have fun!\n\n:red[The creation page has now been unlocked. Find it in the menu on the left side.]"
