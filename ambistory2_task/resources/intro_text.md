# Introduction to the Ambiguous Story Annotation Task

## Overview

You will see a short text of a few sentences, in which one word is highlighted in color. The highlighted word typically can take on two (or more) different meanings, depending on the context. Your task is to annotate which of the two displayed meanings of the word is likely to be the correct one.

The general rules are as follows:

* If one of the word senses is clearly likelier than the other, only pick that one.
* **Important: If both word senses seem plausible, pick both**. Even if one word sense is generally more frequent than the other, both should be picked if the meaning is plausible in the given context.
* If the word has a third word sense that seems more plausible than either of the displayed meanings, pick neither and comment the sense in the free text field.

You can also mark sentences as *nonsensical*, meaning that the text is strange no matter which meaning of the word is used. Even if a sentence is nonsensical, try picking the meaning that makes it 'less nonsensical'. You can simply go with your intuition here. 

Also, feel free to add comments in the comment field.

If the ambiguous word appears multiple times in the text, annotate *only* the instance that is highlighted in color.

There will be times where there is no objectively correct answer. Whatever the case, carefully think about how much sense a reading would make in the context of the sentences.

## Examples

"Amid the gala, her misplaced :blue-background[spectacle] drew everyone's attention. Despite her embarrassment, she fumbled with her eyewear, desperately trying to fix them."

[ ] a blunder that makes you look ridiculous  
[x] optical instrument consisting of a frame that holds a pair of lenses for correcting defective vision

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: In case it is not obvious from the first sentence, the second sentence makes it clear that the spectacle is referring to an accessory. Note that **the sentences are always part of the same story, so you can use information from the second sentence to help you make a choice.**

"No, these shoes :blue-background[fit] perfectly."

[x] be the right size or shape; fit correctly or as desired  
[x] go together

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: **Either meaning may apply depending on the context**. If the speaker tries the shoes on for the first time and comments on their size, the first meaning fits. If the speaker is thinking about what would fit well with an outfit, the second meaning fits better. It is subjective if one is more likely, but they are both very plausible.

"He remarked how :blue-background[light] his bag felt. It was as if the very act of carrying it brought a glow that illuminated his path."

[ ] brightness, illumination  
[x] not heavy  

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)    
**Text is nonsensical**: [x] *(subjective)*

**Explanation**: It doesn't matter what the second sentence says, because the first sentence grammatically wouldn't work with the "brightness, illumination" meaning, so it has to be "not heavy". Also: **Whether a text is nonsensical or not can be subjective!** If you can plausibly imagine that there is some fantasy story about a magic bag that lights up a path, you could argue that this text *does* make sense in some circumstances, in which case it is alright to not mark it as nonsensical.

"The artist wanted to become famous. He tried to :blue-background[draw] attention to his art using vibrant colours."

[ ] make a mark or lines on a surface  
[ ] the finish of a contest in which the score is tied and the winner is undecided

**There is a better meaning**: *to attract*  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: The art-context may make the "make a mark or lines on a surface" sense seem more likely at first glance, but "to draw attention" is a fixed expression that has nothing to do with art. **Since neither meaning fits, tick neither and write a better definition in the text field**.

**There are some sentences that are word plays taking into account multiple word senses. Some of them are solvable, like this:**

"I greatly enjoy this :blue-background[season], whether I am outside enjoying nature or inside watching TV."

[x] a time of year  
[ ] a sequence of related television programmes

**There is a better meaning**: (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [ ]

**Explanation**: It may have been intended as a pun where both meanings apply, but let's take it literally. "Enjoying a television series outside while enjoying nature" seems unlikely. Meanwhile, e.g. enjoying the winter season while warming up in the living room watching TV sounds like a more plausible scenario.

---

**On the other hand, some examples may not be solvable:**

"I wasn't really enjoying this :blue-background[season], with its extreme heat and pointless characters."

[x] a time of year  
[x] a sequence of related television programmes

**There is a better meaning** (leave empty)  
**Text is nonsensical**: [x]

**Explanation**: This too is a word play - the *extreme heat* is referencing the time of year, while *pointless characters* clearly points to a television program. But regardless of whether *season* references a time of year or a television program, **there is really no way for either meaning to make sense by itself**. There is also no other meaning of the word *season* with which the sentence would make more sense. **Therefore, this sentence should be marked as *nonsensical***. **You can also tick both meanings since they are both equally plausible**.

# The Annotation Procedure

You will first have to pass the qualification test, which consists of five questions. **You only have one attempt and you are only allowed one mistake.** Carefully look at the sentences and determine which sense is more likely (or both/neither).

**If you fail at the qualification test**: You will not be able to start the annotation. ***IMPORTANT***: **Remember to copy the Screen-Out Completion Code that will be displayed to Prolific.** If we see that an honest effort was made, you will get a small amount of money as compensation for your time.

**If you succeed at the qualification test**: Once you pass the qualification test, you will automatically unlock access to the annotation page. It is structurally identical to the qualification. Each annotator is assigned around 65 samples. We expect each sample to take 30-60 seconds, so it will likely take around 45 minutes in total.

Your progress for both qualification and annotation is **saved automatically** anytime you press the *NEXT* button.
