# Introduction to the Ambiguity Annotation Task

## Overview

You will see a short text in which one word is highlighted in color. The highlighted word typically can take on multiple different meanings, depending on the context. Your task is to annotate how plausible the displayed meaning of the word is.

**The rules are simple: On a scale from 0 to 5, annotate how plausible an interpretation of a word is in the context of the short text.**

* 0/5: Impossible
* 1-2/5: Possible, but unlikely
* 3-4/5: Possible and likely
* 5/5: Definitely correct

See below for examples.

You can also mark stories as *nonsensical*, meaning that the text is strange no matter which meaning of the word is used. Even if a story is weird, try to pick whatever makes the most sense to you. You can simply go with your intuition here. 

Also, feel free to add comments in the comment field.

If the ambiguous word appears multiple times in the text, annotate *only* the instance that is highlighted in color.

There will be times where there is no objectively correct answer. Whatever the case, carefully think about how much sense a reading would make in the context of the sentences.

## Examples

"The :blue-background[bat] flew out of the cave."

**Meaning of "BAT"**: A sports implement for hitting balls (e.g. in baseball)  

**Your Rating**: 0/5  

**Explanation**: It is much more likely that bat refers to the animal, since it can fly and it lives in caves. You could also argue that maybe someone could have thrown the baseball bat outside of the cave, but that would be a bit far-fetched.

"The letter specified where to meet him. So after reading it, I went to the :blue-background[bank]."  

**Meaning of "BANK"**: a financial institution  

**Your Rating**: 3/5  

**Explanation**: *Bank* could refer to the financial institution, but it could also be a river bank. There is no way to know for sure, so your rating should be somewhere in the middle.

"Mr Ellis walked to the town square with a big smile. He carried his easel with him. He was getting ready to paint. Whenever he sets up his easel in the town square, he always :blue-background[draws] a crowd. His painting of a flower looked really realistic!"

**Meaning of "DRAWS"**: to represent by sketching on a canvas, e.g. with a pen  

**Your Rating**: 0/5  

**Explanation**: It *would be* plausible for "sketching" to be the intended meaning of *draws* here (i.e. he is literally sketching the crowd), were it not for the last sentence. He's not sketching a crowd, he's sketching a flower! So clearly, the actually meaning of *"he always draws a crowd"* is *"he always **attracts** a crowd."* **Always look at the whole story before making your decision!**

"The hotel's service was :blue-background[lousy]. I'm never going there again!"

**Meaning of "LOUSY"**: very bad

**Your Rating**: 5/5

**Explanation**: Obviously, "very bad" is the correct interpretation here. The other interpretation of "lousy" would be if the hotel's service was literally infested with lice, but since "service" is not a physical entity, that is hardly possible.

# The Annotation Procedure

You will first have to pass the qualification test, which consists of three questions. **You only have one attempt at this.** Carefully look at the sentences and determine the plausibility of interpretations. It is mostly to filter out bots and should be easy for English speakers, so don't overthink it.

**If you fail at the qualification test**: You will not be able to start the annotation. ***IMPORTANT***: **Remember to copy the Screen-Out Completion Code that will be displayed to Prolific.** If we see that an honest effort was made, you will get a small amount of money as compensation for your time.

**If you succeed at the qualification test**: Once you pass the qualification test, you will automatically unlock access to the annotation page. It is structurally identical to the qualification. Each annotator is assigned 40 samples. We expect each sample to take 30-60 seconds, so it will likely take around 25 minutes in total.

Your progress for both qualification and annotation is **saved automatically** anytime you press the *NEXT* button.

### **Good luck and have fun!**
