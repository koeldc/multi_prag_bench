# Introduction to the Story Ending Task

## Overview

You will see the first four sentences of a five-sentence short story. Your task is to write one sentence that finishes the short story coherently.

Importantly, the fourth sentence contains a word which has multiple meanings. The story is written in such a way that you wouldn't know which meaning is the one intended by the author by the first four sentences.

**Your ending sentence has to make the intended meaning more plausible than the unintended meaning.** Both meanings will be displayed to you.

**Try to not explicitly spell out the meaning**. Understanding the intended meaning should only be easy to those who pay attention and understand the story. You can achieve this by *avoiding words closely associated with the intended meaning*, and by *only implying the happenings in the fourth sentence instead of outright stating them*. See below for examples.

The story ending should also be *logical* given the first four sentences. The story does not have to be interesting, it just has to make sense and be coherent.

Also, **your ending sentence should NOT include that ambiguous word with multiple meanings from the fourth sentence.**

## Examples

**Story**:  "Mr Ellis walked to the town square with a big smile. He carried his easel with him. He was getting ready to paint. Whenever he sets up his easel in the town square, he always :blue-background[draws] a crowd."

**Intended Meaning of "draws"**: to attract  
**Unintended Meaning of "draws"**: produce an image of something or someone  

**Your Ending Sentence**: Everyone was quite impressed by his picture of a flower.  

**Explanation**: In the first four sentences, it is not clear if he literally sketches a crowd or if he simply attracts a crowd. The ending sentence resolves this by implying that he was sketching a flower, not a crowd.

**Story**: "The battle raged on as the sun began to set. He crouched behind a crumbling wall, desperately scanning the ground. Bullets whizzed past while his heart pounded loudly in his ears. He realized that he only had one :blue-background[shot]".

**Intended Meaning of "shot"**: a chance or opportunity to do something  
**Unintended Meaning of "shot"**: a missile from a firearm

**Your Ending Sentence**: He thought that it was now or never as he attempted to escape from the battle.

**Explanation**: Some stories like this may make it hard to argue for the intended meaning when the unintended meaning seems more likely to begin with. Try to be creative and come up with a way to increase the intended meaning's plausibility. Here, the implication of him running away and the expression "now or never" implies that the amount of shots in his firearm is less important than his chance/opportunity to get away.

# The Annotation Procedure

You will first have to pass the qualification test, which consists of four questions. **You only have one attempt at this.** The qualification test simply asks you to pick the more likely meaning of English words in the context of a sentence. It is mostly to filter out bots and should be no problem to English speakers.

**If you fail at the qualification test**: You will not be able to start writing. ***IMPORTANT***: **Remember to copy the Screen-Out Completion Code that will be displayed to Prolific.** 

**If you succeed at the qualification test**: Once you pass the qualification test, you will automatically unlock access to the writing page. Each writer is assigned around 20 stories.

Your progress for both qualification and writing is **saved automatically** anytime you press the *NEXT* button.
