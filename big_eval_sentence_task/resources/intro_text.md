# Introduction to the Plausibility Annotation Task

## Overview

You will see a sentence that contains a word that can typically take on multiple different meanings, depending on the context. One of those meanings is shown to you.

**Your task is simple: Annotate how plausible a meaning of a word is in the context of the short text using one of five scores:**

* **1**: The displayed meaning is not plausible at all given the context.
* **2**: The displayed meaning is theoretically conceivable, but less plausible than other meanings.
* **3**: The displayed meaning represents one of multiple, similarly plausible interpretations.
* **4**: The displayed meaning represents the most plausible interpretation; other meanings may still be conceivable.
* **5**: The displayed meaning is the only plausible meaning given the context.

See below for examples.

You can also mark sentences as *nonsensical*, meaning that the text is strange no matter which meaning of the word is used. Even if a sentence is nonsensical, try to pick whatever makes the most sense to you. You can simply go with your intuition here. 

Also, feel free to add comments in the comment field.

There will be times where there is no objectively correct answer. Whatever the case, always look at the sentence and carefully think about how plausible each meaning would be.

## Examples

"**The :blue-background[bat] flew out of the cave.**"

**Meaning of "BAT"**: A sports implement for hitting balls (e.g. in baseball)  

**Your Rating**: *1*

**Explanation**: A baseball bat flying out of a cave is inconceivable (or at least rather far-fetched); it obviously refers to an animal.

"The letter specified where to meet him. **So after reading it, I went to the :blue-background[bank].**"  

**Meaning of "BANK"**: a financial institution  

**Your Rating**: *3*

**Explanation**: *Bank* could refer to the financial institution, but it could also be a river bank. Neither one seems particularly plausible compared to the other, so your rating should be in the middle.

**"The composer often writes :blue-background[notes] on a sheet of paper.**

**Meaning of "NOTES"**: a brief written record; a memo

**Your Rating** *2*

**Explanation**: *Notes* could conceivably refer to written memos, but given the context, it is more plausible that she is jotting down musical notes.

**"Whenever he sets up his easel in the town square, he always :blue-background[draws] a crowd. His painting of a flower looked really realistic!"**

**Meaning of "DRAWS"**: to attract; direct towards itself

**Your Rating**: *5*

**Explanation**: Without the last part, it is not clear whether the intended meaning of *draws* is *to sketch* or *to attract*. With the additional context that he is sketching a flower - not a crowd - it becomes clear that *attract* is the only plausible meaning.

# The Annotation Procedure

You will first have to pass the qualification test, which consists of four questions. **You only have one attempt at this.** Carefully look at the sentences and determine the plausibility of meanings. 

**If you fail at the qualification test**: You will not be able to start the annotation. **Remember to copy the Screen-Out Completion Code that will be displayed to Prolific.** 

**If you succeed at the qualification test**: Once you pass the qualification test, you will automatically unlock access to the annotation page. Each annotator is assigned 50 samples.

Your progress for both qualification and annotation is **saved automatically** anytime you press the *NEXT* button.
